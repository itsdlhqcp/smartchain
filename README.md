## Build Ethereum From Scratch - Smart Contracts and More
#### Decentralized Computer.

A decentralized computer is like a normal computer. A normal computer executes a program using one machine.

But a decentralized computer executes a program using multiple machines. Every machine needs to agree upon the output of the program for its results to become official.

To build a decentralized computer, here are the essential elements:

1) A smart contract language.
2) A blockchain.
3) A network.
4) Transactions and accounts.
5) A state management data structure.
